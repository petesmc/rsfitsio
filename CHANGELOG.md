# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.470.1] - 2026.08.16

### Changed
- Large reduction in raw `libc` and unsafe pointer usage: the last raw libc string functions
  are gone from the expression engine, references and constness changes now go through
  `ptr::from_ref`/`from_mut`, `cast_mut`/`cast_const`, `pointer::cast` and `&raw`, and the five
  raw-pointer cast lints are denied package-wide.
- Pedantic clippy lints cleared across the library, tests and the transpiled binaries.
- C-ABI buffer reinterpretations now assert pointer alignment, and the tiled-image scratch
  buffers are allocated with explicit alignment.
- Miri findings documented and the remaining known issues recorded.

### Fixed
- Undefined behaviour reported by Miri: aliasing in the lexer buffer stack, the
  self-referential memory driver, and pointer provenance in `grparser` and `getcol`.
- The lexer no longer defaults `yyin`/`yyout` to the C stdio externs.
- Short-read handling in the memory, file, IRAF and region readers.
- Double free when the `headstart` array fails to grow (#100).

## [0.470.0] - 2026.08.15

### Added
- `fpack` and `funpack`, transpiled from CFITSIO.
- `fitsverify`, transpiled from CFITSIO, with unit tests and coverage.
- Differential oracle test running the expression parser against a recorded corpus.

### Changed
- Synced to CFITSIO 4.7.0 (`d6d2765`).
- Expression parser rewritten around typed enums (`NodeValue`, `ValueSort`, `funcOp`, typed
  operators) instead of unions and integer tags; GTI and region loading split out of
  `New_GTI`/`New_REG`, with regions shared behind an `Rc`.
- Large reduction in `unsafe`: 68 redundant blocks removed, raw pointers dropped from several
  `_safe` functions, error stack messages moved to a fixed-size buffer.
- Clippy clean across the crate, tests and examples; VAX/VMS/Alpha conditionals removed.
- `pliocomp` 0.6, for its worst-case buffer bound.

### Fixed
- Quickselect pivot bug breaking lossy compression reproducibility against CFITSIO (#82).
- `usize` underflow when unshuffling GZIP_2 tiles (#89).
- Image and table compression defects exposed by `fpack`/`funpack`; `BITPIX` and `BLOCKED`
  restored to the img2comp keyword table.
- `printf` conformance for `%g` and the `#` flag.
- `ffdtyp` string detection, hex literal case and bare `.` lexing, constant-folded `ANGSEP`,
  four parser bugs found while testing the expression operators, and a pending syntax error
  being discarded during error recovery.
- The stdout/stdin stream driver, which now writes its memory file through Rust rather than
  the C runtime.

## [0.464.0] - 2026.07.12

### Added
- Test harness ported from CFITSIO, and a large body of unit tests including the compression
  routines.
- Implementations for the remaining `todo!()` stubs: group and hierarchy routines (`ffgt*`,
  `ffgm*`), URL helpers (`fits_get_url`, `fits_url2path`, `fits_relurl2url`, ...), `ffimem`,
  `ffextn`, `ffexist`, `ffpcln`, `ffparsecompspec` and `fits_copy_cell2image`.

### Changed
- Use `core` instead of `std` where possible.

### Fixed
- A significant number of bugs found by the new test harness.
- Compatibility problems found by integration testing against the Python `fitsio` library.
- `iraffits` handling of long Windows filenames and `/` in place of `\`.
- Incorrect `DLONG_MAX`/`DLONG_MIN` on Windows, incorrect `c_char` usage, and mutex poisoning.

## [0.463.0] - 2026.05.30

### Added
- `grparser` (template parser) implementation.
- `histo` (histogram) implementation.

### Changed
- Minimum supported Rust version is 1.96.
- `grparser` uses indices and `Box<[T]>` in place of raw pointers.

### Fixed
- Use after free bug.
- `c_char` casting issue.
- Crash caused by bit string row filters.

## Notes

This project is a direct Rust translation of the cfitsio C library (v4.6.2), maintaining
compatibility while providing Rust's memory safety guarantees. The version numbering
follows cfitsio's version with an additional patch number for Rust-specific changes.

Synchronization with upstream cfitsio is tracked in `SYNCED_COMMIT.md`.
